# 🌍 **Interactive Tableau Dashboard: Visualizing CO2 Emissions**

---

## 📖 **Project Overview**

In this project, I crafted an engaging and interactive dashboard using Tableau Public to illuminate CO2 emissions data. The dashboard features:

- **Visualization 1:** Average CO2 emissions per capita for each country.
- **Visualization 2:** Trends in CO2 production across global regions over time.

The goal was to design a clean, intuitive interface that organizes insights and enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## 🌟 **Project Highlights**

### 🗂 **Dataset**
- Source: World Bank CO2 emissions dataset.

### 📊 **Visualizations**
- **Interactive Map:** Highlights average CO2 emissions per capita by country.
- **Line Chart:** Displays trends in CO2 production across global regions over time.

### 🎨 **Dashboard Features**
- Simplified and intuitive legends for clarity.
- An interactive layout combining multiple visualizations for enhanced insights.

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **1. Setting Up the Project**

- **Platform:** Used Tableau Public Desktop.
- **Dataset Loading:** Imported the World Bank CO2 dataset by navigating to the `My Tableau Repository/Datasources` folder.
- **Organization:** Organized data for streamlined management and reusability.

### **2. Exploring and Understanding the Visualizations**

- **Sheet 1:**
  - Created a **map visualization** showcasing average CO2 emissions per capita for each country.
- **Sheet 2:**
  - Designed a **line chart** to illustrate CO2 production trends across global regions over time.

### **3. Creating the Dashboard**

- Clicked the **Add Dashboard** button to open a new workspace.
- **Positioning Visuals:**
  - Placed the **map** from Sheet 1 at the top.
  - Added the **line chart** from Sheet 2 below the map.

### **4. Cleaning and Optimizing the Dashboard**

- **Clarity:** Removed unnecessary legends, like the topmost legend for CO2 Per Capita (size), to reduce clutter.
- **Floating Legends:** Adjusted the position of remaining legends for a clean, user-friendly layout.

### **5. Final Touches**

- **Legend Placement:**
  - Positioned the **map legend** at the top-right corner of the visualization.
  - Placed the **line chart legend** at the top-right corner of its visualization.
- **Refinement:** Ensured the design is both intuitive and visually appealing.
