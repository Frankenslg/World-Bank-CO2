# Project Overview
In this project, I created an interactive dashboard using Tableau Public to visualize CO2 emissions data. The dashboard integrates two visualizations: the average CO2 emissions per capita of each country and the CO2 production trends across global regions over time. The purpose of this dashboard is to present key insights in an organized and visually appealing way, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data.

## Project Highlights
Dataset: World Bank CO2 emissions dataset.
### Visualizations:
A map showcasing average CO2 emissions per capita.
A line chart displaying CO2 production by global regions over time.
### Dashboard Features:
Simplified legends for clarity.
Interactive layout combining multiple visualizations for better insights.
## Step-by-Step Implementation
### 1. Setting Up the Project
Downloaded and opened the Dashboards Starter Template in Tableau Public Desktop.
Located the Data Source tab and loaded the World Bank CO2 dataset:
Navigated to the My Tableau Repository/Datasources folder.
Organized the dataset for easier management and reuse.
### 2. Exploring and Understanding the Visualizations
Analyzed Sheet 1:
Displayed the average CO2 per capita for each country using a map visualization.
Analyzed Sheet 2:
Created a line chart visualizing CO2 production trends across global regions over time.
### 3. Creating the Dashboard
Clicked the Add Dashboard button to open a new dashboard workspace.
Dragged visualizations into the dashboard:
Positioned the map from Sheet 1 at the top.
Added the line chart from Sheet 2 below the map.
### 4. Cleaning and Optimizing the Dashboard
Removed unnecessary legends:
Deleted the topmost legend for CO2 Per Capita (size) to reduce clutter.
Made remaining legends float:
Adjusted positions for a clean and user-friendly layout.
### 5. Final Touches
Positioned legends:
Placed the map legend at the top-right corner of the visualization.
Placed the line chart legend at the top-right corner of its visualization.
Ensured an intuitive, visually appealing design.
Learnings and Next Steps
This project demonstrates the basics of creating a dashboard in Tableau and the importance of clean, well-structured visualizations in presenting data. Future enhancements may include:

Adding interactivity (e.g., filters, tooltips).
Implementing real-time data updates.
Expanding the dataset to include additional metrics for deeper insights.
